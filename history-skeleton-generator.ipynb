    "# The purpose of this application\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is to take a workbook of spreadsheets with tables for generating events. Using the data in each sheet, rolls for historical \"events\" can be simulated to develop regional timelines for a game world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for this project came from a very interesting article in Johnn Four's Role-Playing Tips Forum about using playing cards to generate timelines of history."

    "# The Timeline Workbook\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data directory, place a spreadsheet workbook called Timeline-Workbook.xlst. It can have an extension xls also. There is a format to the contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The format of the individual worksheets\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three kinds of worksheets in the Timeline-Workbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* timeline overview\n",
    "* primary events\n",
    "* secondary effects\n",
    "\n",
    "## Timeline overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of sheet must be first sheet in the workbook. Include the word *Timelines* in the name of this sheet to identify it. In the demo Timeline-Workbook, it is named, *Base Timelines*. The columns it must contain and what they mean are listed in the subsections below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Regional Group\n",
    "\n",
    "This column should list the various cultural and regional groups that exist in your world. You can be as granualar as you see fit, but each will get only one row. The regions can be as small as a few villages or as vast as a major country.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Major Period, Start, and End\n",
    "\n",
    "For each regional group, *Major Period* is name of the period that will be covered in the timeline skeleton for that race. The *Start* column should indicate the rough year this period started. The *End* column should incidate when the period ended.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Period Length and Range\n",
    "\n",
    "*Period Length* is how long the events generated in the skeleton take place. The *Range* is how much shorter or longer that period will last, adjusted randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these sheets should have the word \"Events\" in the name to identify it as a set of possible events. Their purpose is to aggregate into events into lists by major type. The demo Timeline-Workbook has sheets listed as *Exploration Events*, *Violent Events*, *Hardship Events*, and *Diplomatic Events*, but you can create additional sheets for more types of events, e.g. *Discovery Events* or *Adventurer Events*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of using the word *Events* in the names is to identify all of these sheets to the application when it loads the workbook into dataframes. Each Event sheet will have equal random weight assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns for *Primary Events* sheets are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Roll\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign a unique integer to each number under the *Roll* column. That will be the number used on a random roll. The rows will be sorted by number. Any skipped numbers will be determined as a \"GM's Choice\" with the name of the sheet appearing the skeleton as a hint to type of event to choose. This gives an easy way to allow the GM to pick something special from particularly ugly event types.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Event\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief description of the event should appear here.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Follow Up\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief description of any follow up actions you need to do to flesh it out (if you feel it necessary).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "These are keyword effects of the event. They each have an impact, good or bad on the region. A list of these keywords and their definitions is in the section, *Secondary Effects*. Only use these key words. If you find a keyword you would like to add, add it to the discussion on GitHub to add it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Active\n",
    "\n",
    "This describes how long this event will affect the region. Some are very short, others can be so catestrophic that everyone living there is effectively wiped out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Secondary Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Seconday Events are secondary outcomes from primary events. Use the keywords listed below to create your own custom *secondary events table*. This application will scan the workbook for keywords matching those below. If it finds a worksheet name that contains the keyword, it will add it to the list of Secondary Events and use the worksheet as a rolling table. The format for such a worksheet is in the subsection after *Keywords*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any keyword that does not have a matching sheet will be treated as a demographic effect. So, increases and decreases cancel each other for that community. You should make a determination if a community collapses if certain demographics drop too far, such as Wealth, Trade, Population, or even Military.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Any worksheet that does *not* contain a keyword or timeline in its sheet name will be ignored by this application. You can use that behavior to add your own personal worksheets to the workbook without fear of breaking anything. Also, if you want this application to use the same table for more than one keyword (e.g. *persecution* and *privileged*), insert both keywords in the sheet name. The keywords tests are not case sensitive, but capitalizing names of worksheets in a workbook looks professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will deal with what the keywords mean, then the format of secondary event sheets will follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Each keyword is prefixed by a \"+\" or \"-\". This indicates adding or subtracting a quantity. Not all \"adds\" are good things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, any keyword that you want to become a demographic or just a reminder to come up with something on your own, just rename the corresponding worksheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional recommendation: When you have a table for a keyword that does have increase and decrease, only perfectly matching opposites will cancel each other out. See the *Magic* keyword below for a good example.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adventure Site\n",
    "\n",
    "This is reserved for mostly above ground adventure sites. That includes forests, ruins, crashed ships, etc. Only time removes adventure sites (or adventurers). Feel free to further flesh out this table to customize it to your campaign style.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ally, Tensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Alliances can make or break social structures in any world. Tensions can weaken alliances. You have to decide when too much tension has built up for the alliance to survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ancient Tech\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is that powerful \"lost magic\" or \"lost technology\" has surfaced somehow. This is something that you have to decide if you want to include in your campaign. If not, treat it as a \"GM Chooses\" moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Artifact\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful artifact has been found. I did not create a table of these for this application because these types of magic items generally need a very personal touch (or good suggestions, at which studios such as LoreSmyth and Legendary Games excel).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Civil War\n",
    "\n",
    "With a civil war, you should take time to decide the scope. Is it limited to a local uprising or is it a much bigger revolt. Is it a revolt or a local noble choosing to reject the large realm. Consider comparing it neighboring regions to see if they are also in revolt.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Curse\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also an issue of scope. Is this a local, regional, or major kingdom level event? That is why there is no table included with the one either.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Enemy\n",
    "\n",
    "I would recommend creating a table of your factions locally or regionally to use here. There is an *Enemy Options* worksheet included, but it is only there to make suggestions. This table might even need to regionally specific. If so, make timeline workbooks that are narrowly focused.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Magic\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a \"demographic\" that has been fleshed out to affect specific schools of magic. I restricted the included table to the main ones in DnD or PF, but feel free to add all kinds of additional schools that relate to major subclasses if you so desire. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced or diminished magic literally means that spells and feats in that area are correspondingly weaker in effect, are at greater danger of failure, or automatically at a disadvantage against casters in unaffected schools. You need to choose how that plays out and how much it will stack if multiple levels of reduction hit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increase or enhance magic means the exact opposite. Feats and spells in that area work better here, with increased damage, increased critical success, automatic successes, reduced chance of failure, or automatic advantage over other unaffected schools. Again, it is up the GM to decide how these stack or if they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increases in the same area cancel diminished magic of the same school. The application handles that part automatically, if there is a table containing keyword \"Magic*. Otherwise it will have handled like a demographic affecting all magic or feats with the usual cancellation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to use this table or your own version of it, cancellation of the effect occurs over sufficient time or, as indicated in the last paragraph, when the same school suffers that opposite effect. In any event, it should never be a permanent effect. The fun part is explaining why or how it happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Military\n",
    "\n",
    "This keyword is unique and handled uniquely. The application is designed to treat this table as levels of military development. The Military worksheet is rudimentary, but it lays out the unique format. There is no \"rolling dice\" here. There are simply increases in levels of military build up. At some level, Armies add Navies. Eventually, Navies begin to utilize their own \"army\" (called Marines usually). In some high fantasy and steampunk worlds, flying warships, fighters, and/or bombers might be possible. If so, Armies and, eventually, Navies develop their own air corps.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are built-in options in the demo tables to reduce levels of Military development. Decreased or diminished Military means that the region loses some of the gains previously discussed. When it drops to 0, the region can barely provide guards to watch for major crimes or fires, much less defend against attacks of any kind. Below zero means that it cannot raise even a basic watch. It stays that way until either the Military value rises again or sufficient time passes or, more likely, the region falls under someone else's rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Persecutions, Privileged\n",
    "\n",
    "These two keywords use the same worksheet in the demo Timeline-Workbook to resolve who is affected by the result. If you want to allow for regional prejudices, such as xenophobia in a specific culture, remove one of the keywords from the existing worksheet, then create a new one, editing both to simulate growing potential xenophobia. As persecutions or privileges, GMs have to decide what stacking of them means to the culture. As with magic, levels of persecution of a group cancel the same number of levels of privilege. The same is true regarding the duration of such social changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Population\n",
    "\n",
    "The demo Timeline-Workbook treats this as a demographic. Population increases and decreases cancel each other out. There could be regions in a world where a GM might want to track specific population changes instead of treating it as a demographic. If so, simple create a worksheet with the keyword *Population* in the name to change the applications behavior. It will give more granular results for regions and cities with diverse populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Power\n",
    "\n",
    "The demo also treats this keyword as a demographic. This is a measure of the influence of the target region over its population and its neighbors. It does not necessarily mean aggression. Increased power or decreased power might simply reflect changes in the strength of the current governing bodies or individuals. It can also indicate growin or waning influence in the larger region. Time or the opposite demographic should cancel out these effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When drilling down to smaller regional views, adding a worksheet to make the affect more granular could be very useful for simulating factional and regional politics locally and in the larger regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Raiders\n",
    "\n",
    "The demo treats this as a demographic because only a GM would know which groups make sense to be raiders in the region dealing with the violence or hardship. This could be \"monster\" raiders or criminal syndicates. If you want to make this granular, simply create a *Raiders* worksheet in the Timeline-Workbook and the application will do the rest for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Religion\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a tab in the demo workbook with suggestions for how to great more granularity for this keyword. Include any cults that are included in your world to the worksheet. It will help simulate their spreading influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Trade\n",
    "\n",
    "*Trade* is treated as a demographic in the demo workbook, but you can create more granularity by making a worksheet that lists trade goods. Many trade goods come from non-renewable resources. As such, they should fade out over time as mines or wells run dry. Grown goods and livestock can deplete due to droughs, blights, or other natural disasters. Long term climate changes (which are beyond the scope of this project) can also make renewable resources disappear or become more abundant. Keep these things in mind when considering the duration of these events.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tribute State\n",
    "\n",
    "The demo workbook also treats this a demographic because only GMs would know which regions could become subject to rule of another region. Again, simply create a worksheet with the word *Tribute State* in the name to flesh this out regionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Underdark\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also treated as a demographic because underdarks are deep underground catecombs that connect into extensive cavern systems. An underdark can be a small as a few minor dungeons or as vast as an entire underground city. Rather than dictate this one, it is better left to the GM to create their own tables for what a local underdark could mean. To do so, simply add a worksheet with *Underdark* in the name and follow the rules for making a secondary events worksheet in the next subsection.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Wealth\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Trade, this is treated as a demographic in the demo workbook. To add a more granular look at growing or fading wealth in a region, simply add a worksheet with the keyword *Wealth* to the workbook. Like *Trade*, increases and decreases cancel each other out, even in granular simulations. The reason *Wealth* is separated from *Trade* is that *Wealth* can wane even when plenty of trade takes place. It can also grow despite trade levels if a region is relatively self-sufficient."

    "### Structure of Secondary Events worksheets\n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception of Military, all of the Secondary Events worksheets have the same format. It must have three columns. The first is called *Roll*, the second *Max*, and the third can be anything that helps explain how to use the table in this worksheet. *Roll* and *Max* must be integers and *Max* must greater than or equal to the *Roll* value. These value set the range of values that produce the result in Column 3. *Do not overlap any ranges.* The application will take these values and sort them in numerical order. Then, it determines the minimum and maximum values to determine the full range of values covered by this table. Any values skipped will show up as \"GM's Choice\" if those values are randomly generated. This eliminates the need to add \"GM's Choice\" to the third column.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Military\n",
    "\n",
    "The Military is different. There is special code that simply adds or subtracts a level when ever +Military or -Military shows up in a result. This does trigger a printout of the current Military Level of the region in the timeline report.\n",
    "\n",
    "This format corresponds to this usage as well. It should have two columns, *Level* and *Military Development*. The Level must be an integer. The lowest level should be set to Zero, which the demo worksheet lists as Basic Guard only. Keep the levels in sequence. It does not have to progress as fast as the demo. Alternatives could indicate how far the growing security of the Army reaches into the surrounding territory to make it safer for travelers instead growing Navies. This demo table simply gives a nice go-by to see a progression to full Air, Land, and Sea power."
