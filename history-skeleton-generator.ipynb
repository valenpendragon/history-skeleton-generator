    "# The purpose of this application\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is to take a workbook of spreadsheets with tables for generating events. Using the data in each sheet, rolls for historical \"events\" can be simulated to develop regional timelines for a game world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for this project came from a very interesting article in Johnn Four's Role-Playing Tips Forum about using playing cards to generate timelines of history."

    "# Timeline Workbook\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data directory, place a spreadsheet workbook called Timeline-Workbook.xlst. It can have an extension xls also. There is a format to the contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The format of the individual worksheets\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three kinds of worksheets in the Timeline-Workbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* timeline overview\n",
    "* primary events\n",
    "* secondary effects\n",
    "\n",
    "## Timeline overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of sheet must be first sheet in the workbook. Include the word *Timelines* in the name of this sheet to identify it. In the demo Timeline-Workbook, it is named, *Base Timelines*. The columns it must contain and what they mean are listed in the subsections below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Regional Group\n",
    "\n",
    "This column should list the various cultural and regional groups that exist in your world. You can be as granualar as you see fit, but each will get only one row. The regions can be as small as a few villages or as vast as a major country.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Major Period, Start, and End\n",
    "\n",
    "For each regional group, *Major Period* is name of the period that will be covered in the timeline skeleton for that race. The *Start* column should indicate the rough year this period started. The *End* column should incidate when the period ended.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Period Length and Range\n",
    "\n",
    "*Period Length* is how long the events generated in the skeleton take place. The *Range* is how much shorter or longer that period will last, adjusted randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these sheets should have the word \"Events\" in the name to identify it as a set of possible events. Their purpose is to aggregate into events into lists by major type. The demo Timeline-Workbook has sheets listed as *Exploration Events*, *Violent Events*, *Hardship Events*, and *Diplomatic Events*, but you can create additional sheets for more types of events, e.g. *Discovery Events* or *Adventurer Events*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of using the word *Events* in the names is to identify all of these sheets to the application when it loads the workbook into dataframes. Each Event sheet will have equal random weight assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns for *Primary Events* sheets are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Roll\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign a unique integer to each number under the *Roll* column. That will be the number used on a random roll. The rows will be sorted by number. Any skipped numbers will be determined as a \"GM's Choice\" with the name of the sheet appearing the skeleton as a hint to type of event to choose. This gives an easy way to allow the GM to pick something special from particularly ugly event types.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Event\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief description of the event should appear here.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Follow Up\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief description of any follow up actions you need to do to flesh it out (if you feel it necessary).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "These are keyword effects of the event. They each have an impact, good or bad on the region. A list of these keywords and their definitions is in the section, *Secondary Effects*. Only use these key words. If you find a keyword you would like to add, add it to the discussion on GitHub to add it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Active\n",
    "\n",
    "This describes how long this event will affect the region. Some are very short, others can be so catestrophic that everyone living there is effectively wiped out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Secondary Events\n",
    "\n",
    "These are secondary outcomes from primary events. Some of these keywords connect to *Secondary Events* tables specific to the keyword, but some simply raise or lower a demographic. Naturally, as a GM, if the demographic drops too much, this group is effectively gone and their cities and towns might be ruins.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will deal with what the keywords mean, then the format of secondary event sheets will follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will deal with keywords. Each keyword is prefixed by a \"+\" or \"-\". This indicates adding or subtracting a quantity. Not all added are good things.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adventure Site\n",
    "##### Ally, Tensions\n",
    "##### Ancient Tech\n",
    "##### Artifact\n",
    "##### Civil War\n",
